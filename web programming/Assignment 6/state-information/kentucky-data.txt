Kentucky is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by seven states: Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio to the north, West Virginia and Virginia to the east, Tennessee to the south, and Missouri to the west. Kentucky's western border is defined by the Mississippi River. The state's geography is diverse, ranging from the rolling hills of the Appalachians in the east to the flatlands and farmland of the western region.

With a population of approximately 4.5 million people, Kentucky is the 26th most populous state in the U.S. Its largest city, Louisville, sits on the Ohio River and serves as a major cultural and economic hub. The state capital, Frankfort, is situated in the central region.

Kentucky's economy is driven by a variety of industries. Historically known for its agriculture, particularly tobacco and horse breeding, the state has diversified its economy in recent decades. Manufacturing, especially automotive manufacturing, plays a significant role, with several major automobile assembly plants located in the state. Coal mining has been a longstanding industry, although it has declined in recent years. Tourism, centered around attractions such as the Kentucky Derby, bourbon distilleries, and natural landmarks like Mammoth Cave National Park, also contributes to the state's economy.
