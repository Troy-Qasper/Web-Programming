Maine, nestled in the northeastern corner of the United States, is a state defined by its rugged coastline, dense forests, and picturesque seaside villages. It shares borders with only one state, New Hampshire, to the west, while its expansive coastline meets the Atlantic Ocean to the east and south.

With a population of around 1.3 million people, Maine is one of the least densely populated states in the country. Its largest city, Portland, is a vibrant cultural and economic center known for its historic Old Port district, bustling waterfront, and thriving food scene. The state capital, Augusta, situated along the Kennebec River, is smaller in size but holds significant historical and governmental importance.

Maine's economy has traditionally been based on industries such as fishing, forestry, and agriculture. Lobstering is a particularly iconic and lucrative industry, with Maine's lobster fisheries being among the largest in the world. Additionally, the state is known for its production of blueberries, potatoes, and maple syrup.

In recent years, Maine has also seen growth in tourism, as visitors are drawn to its natural beauty, outdoor recreational opportunities, and charming coastal towns. Acadia National Park, located on Mount Desert Island, is a major attraction, offering breathtaking scenery, hiking trails, and opportunities for wildlife viewing. Additionally, Maine's numerous lighthouses, historic landmarks, and cultural festivals contribute to its appeal as a tourist destination.
